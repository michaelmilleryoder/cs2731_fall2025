title: "Homework 0: CRCD JupyterHub setup"
---

**Due 2025-09-03, 11:59pm**. *Instructions last updated 2025-08-25.*

This assignment is simply for you to get set up with the running Jupyter notebooks on the CRCD JupyterHub. We will use JupyterHub for in-class coding activities.

## Instructions

1. Make sure you can log in to the CRCD JupyterHub at [jupyter.crc.pitt.edu](https://jupyter.crc.pitt.edu) with your Pitt credentials. You can select the default **Teach - 6 cores, 3 hours** as your job profile. If you are off-campus or not on WIRELESS-PITTNET, you will need to log in to the Pitt VPN through the GlobalProtect app. Instructions for setting that up are [here](https://services.pitt.edu/TDClient/33/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=293).
2. Click the following [nbgitpuller link](https://jupyter.crc.pitt.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmichaelmilleryoder%2Fcs1671_jupyterhub&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fcs1671_jupyterhub%2F&branch=main){target="_blank"}. This should load the newest version of `session2_text_normalization.ipynb`, which should look like [this](https://github.com/michaelmilleryoder/cs1671_jupyterhub/blob/main/session2_text_normalization.ipynb){target="_blank"} if you're curious.
3. Double-click `session2_text_normalization.ipynb` on the left-hand side panel to open the Jupyter notebook. It should not matter what kernel is selected. The default **Python 3 (ipykernel)** is fine.
4. Run the first set of cells under the **Setup** section. Note that you will have to restart the kernel after using pip to install packages. That is all you have to do. You do not have to run the rest of the notebook.
5. Take a screenshot of the output of those first cells, including `import nltk`, and submit it on Canvas. Ideally you are able to `import nltk`, but even if there are errors, that's okay! You will still get credit for the assignment, and I will message you on Canvas to try to figure any issues out.
