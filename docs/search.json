In this project, students will demonstrate an ability to summarize current approaches and challenges in a subfield of NLP and implement some sort of contribution (however small) to this NLP area of research or practice.\nProjects will be done in groups of 2-4 students. Groups will be formed during an in-class project match day, largely based on interest in the same project ideas."

    "text": "Project idea form\nDue 09-11.\nFill out project ideas you might be interested in working on in this form. You can fill out ideas from the example projects listed below or one of your own ideas. For your own ideas, consider what what research you’re interested in, what system you’d like to build that processes language in some form, interesting text datasets you’d like to work on, really anything! It is best if your idea has a dataset in mind, but this is not required.\nYou can fill out as many ideas as you’d like with this form. Ideas do not have to be fully sketched out. Submitting an idea does not mean you will necessarily work on it. These ideas will be presented to all students anonymously. Each student must submit at least one idea for credit on this assignment, even if it’s just chosen from the example projects.\n\nExample projects\nSome of these projects are drawn from “shared tasks” where NLP researchers compete for the best performance on certain datasets. Others are based on ideas and projects from prior students and from the instructor.\n\n1. Text classification\n\nClassify adversarial prompts for LLMs based on attack type, using publicly available red-teaming datasets.\nClassify discourse relations, the relationship between pieces of text within longer narratives (such as the reason or supporting evidence behind a claim). See DISRPT 2025 shared task 3, data repo here in collaboration with Prof. Janet Liu in the Linguistics Department.\nGiven a review of a restaurant, determine what type of restaurant it is from this Yelp dataset\nGiven a short essay in response to a troubling news article, predict the level of empathy. See WASSA 2024 shared task Track 3.\nPredict emotion labels from tweets across many languages. See WASSA 2024 shared task\nGiven a news article and a list of “entities” (people, organizations, etc), predict roles such as protagonist, antagonist, and innocent. See SemEval 2025 Task 10, Subtask 1 on entity framing\nPredict news genre or media “frames” such as morality, economic, or crime and punishment from news articles in multiple languages. See SemEval 2023 Task 3, Subtasks 1 or 2\nPredict whether text was written by humans or generated by AI. Tasks include predicting for data across languages and for academic essays. See GenAI Content Detection Workshop, Task 1 or 2\nClassify tweets as sexist or not, or predict the “intent” of sexist tweets as direct, reported or judgemental. See EXIST 2024 Task 1 or Task 2\nPredict if similar words are redundant or not with the Semantic Pleonasm corpus developed right here at Pitt.\nFrom a set of descriptions of characters, develop a classifier to predict which ones will generate the most fanfiction. This could be a lens into online community and media norms.\nPredict “speech acts”, intentions behind utterances, based on emojis with a dataset assembled by former students in the class.\n\n\n\n2. Machine translation\n\nTrain translation models for literary text and evaluate on a dataset of Korean-English webnovels developed by a former student in this class.\nTranslate customer service chats in between languages. See the WMT 2024 Chat Shared Task\nTranslate code-mixed Hinglish to English. See the WMT 2022 Code-mixed Machine Translation Task\nCreate a system to automatically correct (post-edit) machine translations. See the WMT 2022 Automatic Post-Editing Shared Task\n\n\n\n3. Information retrieval and extraction\n\nGiven a query, retrieve the most relevant passages from regulatory documents: https://www.codabench.org/competitions/3527/\nExtract important entities from scientific articles with the SCIRex dataset\n\n\n\n\n4. Analysis and annotation of datasets\n\nImprove part-of-speech tagging and other linguistic annotation for spontaneous speech in the Archive of Pittsburgh Language and Speech (APLS) with collaborator Prof. Dan Villarreal in the Linguistics Department. An evaluation dataset for parts of speech has already been manually annotated and so this project is ready to go to evaluate different systems! This work would help linguistics researchers study specific linguistic phenomena by speakers here in Pittsburgh.\nVisualize similarities in US state legislature bill texts and predict bill passage using data from LegiScan (example repo here).\nDevelop an annotation guide and start annotating a new dataset of online gaming voice chat for hate speech, abusive, and offensive language.\nHate speech is culturally specific, yet the majority of NLP work focuses on English in North American and European contexts. A quantitative analysis of different features of datasets annotated for hate speech in multiple languages and from multiple cultural contexts would illuminate global similarities and culturally specific contexts.\nFanfiction, online writing by fans of media works, is known for celebrating queer identity but still may center the experiences of white authors and characters. Use FanfictionNLP to compare representations of characters of color to white characters in fanfiction at scale.\nQuantitative analysis of hateful, white supremacist narratives usually centers on contemporary online discourse. Yet many white supremacist language and narratives has its roots before online discourse. Compare narratives, topics and themes presented in historic and contemporary white supremacist discourse with data provided by the instructor.\nExplore similarities and differences between language in podcasts and Reddit communities based on those podcasts using a dataset assembled by former students in the class.\nComputational analysis of Palestinian Nakba narratives. See workshop and datasets.\nExamine the framing of different entities in police Facebook posts from the Plain View Project.\nAnalyze how different newspapers cover topics differently in English-language editorials from Sri Lankan newspapers. Data is provided by the instructor and a collaborator at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\n\n\n5. Survey papers\n\nSurvey how NLP is used and applied in other fields before and after LLMs. What has been our most useful contributions to scholars in the social sciences, physical sciences, or humanities? This survey would assemble papers across disciplines for mentions of NLP and summarize what is most useful, what is lacking, and what approaches from NLP could be helpful to others.\nComputational social science using NLP generally relies on data from online communities. But this is missing non-online interactions and the practices of those who are not active online. Survey datasets and approaches that use quantitative and computational techniques on recordings of offline linguistic interaction.\nA growing area of research in computational social science aims to capture the framing and portrayal of entities across large text corpora (such as in news media). Survey existing approaches and challenges.\n\n\n\n6. Other\n\nEvaluate LLMs for their factuality in summarization of class reflections using a dataset provided by the instructor and Prof. Diane Litman.\nEvaluate the fairness of quality scores automatically assigned to sutdent reflections using a dataset provided by the instructor and Prof. Diane Litman.\nNew identity terms are commonly developed in online communities, some of them hateful. Develop methods to find in-group hate jargon and identity terms.\nBuild networks of characters and predict relations among characters in fiction using this dataset.\nStancetaking, a concept from sociolinguistics, is when speakers take an evaluative position toward the concept (which are often nuanced, e.g. “No, I actually don’t like Taylor Swift’s music that much, but she’s great as a person”). Develop automated methods for identifying the “stance object”, who the speaker is evaluating, likely from Reddit data.\nAutomatically summarize movies based on their subtitles from this dataset developed by former students in the class."

There is no required length or format for this report, but it is recommended to use the ACL format that the final report will be formatted in. This proposal will contain answers to a series of questions. It will include a peer review where you will rate your own performance and the performance of other group members through the form here.\n\nTask: What is the problem or task you are focusing on?\nInput and output: What is the format of the input and output of this task? For example, each input could be a sentence of text and the output could be a label from a discrete set of possible labels. Provide at least one example of input and output from your data (ideally actual input and output, but it’s fine if they are made up).\nLiterature review: How does your contribution build on or extend prior work? How have others approached your task or similar tasks? What are other NLP papers that use the same dataset or domain as your project? This literature review will be of at least 3 papers relevant to your project area. It will group and summarize relevant papers into types of tasks, datasets, and/or approaches. Good places to look for NLP papers include the ACL Anthology, Semantic Scholar, and Google Scholar.\nData: What data are you using? How many datapoints does the dataset contain and what is the composition of each datapoint? Please explain where these datasets are from and how they were constructed. Has any other research been published using these datasets? Provide links to any URLs if the data is hosted online or cite papers if the dataset is published somewhere. Does the dataset have annotated labels or “gold” text that you are predicting or generating provided? If so, where do those labels come from?\nMethods: What approaches are you planning on taking to address the task? What models and if appropriate, what methods of extracting features from text will be used? Prompting strategies for decoder-only LLMs are good, but there should be some comparison with another strategy, such as fine-tuning an encoder-only LLM such as BERT or comparing with classical statistical and n-gram approaches. Talk to the instructor if you have more questions about this, as there is flexibility depending on your specific project.\nEvaluation: How are you evaluating your approach? What performance metrics are you going to use?\nEthics: What kinds of ethical issues may be raised by your model or data?\nSteps: What are the proposed steps needed for completion of (your proposed part) of the project? This should be in some detail, for example, loading and potentially cleaning the data, training models, trying different parameters, evaluating models, etc.\nRoles: What are roles and tasks of each person in the group? Though group members will contribute in various capacities, it is best if each person is responsible for at least one aspect of the project."

It’s fine to be working with multiple datasets; just complete this for each one or for a final dataset you will be using if you are combining datasets.\n\nThe number of rows (datapoints) in the dataset and what each datapoint corresponds to. If you are splitting the dataset into a training, test, and possible dev sets, how many rows are in each?\nThe number of columns in the dataset you will be using and what each corresponds to.\nIf applicable, the distribution of the target labels you are predicting. So for a binary sentiment classification task, how many rows in each set (except the test set) are marked negative or positive sentiment? This can be in a table or graph format.\nOptionally, any other distribution or data visualization that you think is helpful for understanding your dataset or task.\n\n\n\nPart 2: Some kind of result\nPlease provide one (hopefully quantitative) result from your work so far. A good example would be a performance metric result from your baseline approach on a dev or test set, but it could also be some sort of other finding you have so far. But if you’re not that far yet, you can also provide an example of working input and output from your system or part of a system, some sort of plot or other output.

The project does not necessarily need to be successful in the sense that it outperforms baselines or contributes to our knowledge of a phenomenon. Sometimes ideas don’t work, and that’s okay. But you need to provide evidence of progress toward that contribution. If you are building a dataset, for example, the dataset needs to be built in some form, even if it is as not as large or as useful as you may have hoped. If you are evaluating a new method for a task, you must have an implementation that tests that method against other baselines, even if it doesn’t perform as well as you would have hoped or you didn’t get to evaluate it against all the baselines you wanted to. If you are doing a survey, you must distill a sufficient number of papers into themes that comprehensively describe a research area, even if you don’t end up finding groundbreaking gaps in knowledge that must be addressed. Feel free to take on more risky ideas, but only if you know you’ll have something to show for it at the end. Teaching staff will guide you toward scoping projects that should fulfill this goal in the planning phase through the proposal."

    "text": "2. Build n-gram language models\nIn this section, you will build a simple n-gram language model that can be used to generate random text resembling a source document. This model does not need any smoothing.\nIn the NgramModel class, write an initialization method __init__(self, c) which stores the context length c of the model and initializes any necessary internal variables. Then write a method get_vocab(self) that returns the vocab (this is the set of all characters used by this model).\nWrite a method update(self, text) which computes the n-grams for the input sentence and updates the internal counts (storing counts is recommended instead of storing probabilities). Also, write a method prob(self, context, char) which accepts a c-length string representing a context and a character, and returns the probability of that character occurring, given the preceding context. Characters that have never been seen before in a certain context would be assigned a 0 probability. If you encounter a novel context (one that has never been seen before in training data), the probability of any given character should be \\(1/V\\) where \\(V\\) is the size of the vocabulary. See Chapter 3 of the Jurafsky and Martin textbook and Equation 3.12 for calculating probabilities based on observed counts. You may not use any package to directly train/compute language model probabilities; that portion of the program should be from scratch.\n &gt;&gt;&gt; m = NgramModel(1)\n &gt;&gt;&gt; m.update('abab')\n &gt;&gt;&gt; m.get_vocab()\n {'a', 'b'}\n &gt;&gt;&gt; m.update('abcd')\n &gt;&gt;&gt; m.get_vocab()\n {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}\n &gt;&gt;&gt; m.prob('a', 'b')\n 1.0\n &gt;&gt;&gt; m.prob('~', 'c')\n 0.0\n &gt;&gt;&gt; m.prob('b', 'c')\n 0.5\nWrite a method random_char(self, context) which returns a random character according to the probability distribution determined by the given context. Just like the prob function, in a novel context assign a probability of any given character \\(1/V\\), where \\(V\\) is the size of the vocabulary.\n\nHere is some example output. Even with setting the random seed, your output does not need to perfectly match the example output as there are multiple functions that can perform this task.\n     &gt;&gt;&gt; m = NgramModel(0)\n     &gt;&gt;&gt; m.update('abab')\n     &gt;&gt;&gt; m.update('abcd')\n     &gt;&gt;&gt; random.seed(1)\n     &gt;&gt;&gt; [m.random_char('') for i in range(10)]\n     ['a', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'a']\nIn the NgramModel class, write a method random_text(self, length) which returns a string of characters chosen at random using the random_char(self, context) method. Your starting context should always be c ~ characters, and the context should be updated as characters are generated. If c == 0, your context should always be the empty string. You should continue generating characters until you’ve produced the specified number of random characters, then return the full string.\nHere is some example output. Even with setting the random seed, your output does not need to perfectly match the example output as there are multiple functions that can perform this task.\n     &gt;&gt;&gt; m = NgramModel(1)\n     &gt;&gt;&gt; m.update('abab')\n     &gt;&gt;&gt; m.update('abcd')\n     &gt;&gt;&gt; random.seed(1)\n     &gt;&gt;&gt; m.random_text(10)\n     abcdbabcda"

Any student suspected of violating this obligation for any reason during the semester will be required to participate in the procedural process, initiated at the instructor level, as outlined in the University Guidelines on Academic Integrity. To learn more about Academic Integrity, visit the Academic Integrity Guide for an overview of the topic. For hands-on practice, complete the Academic Integrity Modules.\n\nGenerative AI policy\nYou are allowed to use generative AI programs (ChatGPT, etc.) as a student in this course in limited circumstances. Since much of this course is about developing such tools in NLP, using currently available tools can expose you to the current capabilities and limitations of such systems.\nHowever, your ethical responsibilities as a student remain the same. You must follow the University of Pittsburgh’s Policy on Academic Integrity. Here are some principles to keep in mind that can help you determine whether or not a specific use of generative AI is acceptable in this course (for all forms of generation: writing, code, images or other forms). Please ask the instructor if you are not sure about a specific use. You will not be blamed or retaliated against for asking.\n\nUse as an aid, not for a finished product. LLMs could be used in this course to generate ideas, draft bibliographies, study guides, or for revising existing writing. Use for drafting entire homework or project reports is not acceptable, even if students revise this draft, since being able to communicate NLP procedures and research is a learning objective. Also keep in mind that language models have no notion of reality and will hallucinate facts and citations.\nCite its use. The University of Pittsburgh’s academic integrity policy applies to all uncited or improperly cited use of content, whether that work is created by human beings alone or in collaboration with a generative AI. If you use a generative AI tool to develop content for an assignment, you are required to cite the tool’s contribution to your work. In practice, cutting and pasting content from any source without citation is plagiarism. Likewise, paraphrasing content from a generative AI without citation is plagiarism. Similarly, using any generative AI tool without appropriate acknowledgement will be treated as plagiarism. See the APA guidelines on how to cite ChatGPT. Citing your use of LLMs will also inform teaching staff on how such tools are being used in education for developing better future policies.\nYou are responsible for the work you turn in. As we will discuss in this course, LLMs and other generative AI systems can and do generate biased, socially problematic language and assert unfounded claims. Ultimately the text you submit will be treated as reflecting your own work, and you are responsible for it.\n\nAdapted from faculty in the Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy, with guidance from the Carnegie Mellon University Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence."
